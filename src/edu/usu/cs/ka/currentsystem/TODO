Check with Dr. Bryce:
*The RiskCounter method getFailureExplanationSentence_BDDRef() - for G vs. L
*The Agent method removeFailFromKBForNewPlan() - needed for O vs. P
*The Agent method isActionApplicable(). - G vs. L, R vs. C
*The Agent method insertSandorFSentenceIntoKB_withFailVarAndOP() - O vs. P
*Note that Fault and RiskCounter have additional methods to that of Bryce's version.
*Should Agent method updateActions() remove the risks learned?

*How will sending the KB into the planner reduce the variables described?
*Should have a variable for re-planning after each incomplete action taken?
*Where to check if KB entails failVar? Likely in isActionApplicable().
*Where to remove failVar? - on preparing for getting a new plan.

Notes:
The Assumptive Agent might be ok if we wanted to break out of "same plan" loops.
We might just want to check for repeating plan loops and break out -fail- right there...

1:RISKY vs. CONSERVATIVE
*Will there become a case where the plans refuse to change if being conservative?
*Likely. Thus, the ASSUMPTIVE agent might employed to break out of loops..

3:GREEDY VS LOOKAHEAD
Will the LOOKAHEAD agent will run into a repeating plan loop where its first action is
going to cause the plan to fail and thus is never taken?
*OK to set the solver to null?

4: OPTIMISTIC vs. PESSIMISTIC - clarify that this case still exists now that FAIL is used
*How does this case impact isActionFailure() 
	- the test for this is currently simply whether some effect didn't occur...

TO DO:
2: EXACT VS ASSUMPTIVE
*finish the method learnUnsatPossPreconditionsAndUpdateAction():
	-smaller version of learnAboutActionTaken() stating that all possPres are pre's.
	-smaller version of insertSandorFSentenceIntoKB().
	-calls updateActions();
*It may well be that Dr. Bryce's new v. of planners uses the enhanced KB to dissuade the repeated use of a same action whose possPre's are now listed as a known risk in the BDD.

TEST:
*FREGO first, see if same results.
*The FAIL var and its removal.
*Entailment of the PlanFailureExplanation and the KB.

DONE (needs testing, however):
1. RISKY  		vs. CONSERVATIVE
3. GREEDY 		vs. LOOKAHEAD
4. OPTIMISTIC 	vs. PESSIMISTIC
5. STRICT 		vs. FORGIVING
